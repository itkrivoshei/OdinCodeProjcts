# 🧑‍💻 OdinCodeProjects

Welcome to the OdinCodeProjects repository, featuring various coding projects I've developed from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). These projects are focused on different concepts in JavaScript/TypeScript.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. To run these projects locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/itkrivoshei/OdinCodeProjcts.git
```

3. After cloning, install the dependencies at the root of the repository:

```
npm i
```

3. Then, feel free to navigate to each project's directory to explore further.

## 🔧 Development Tools

To maintain high code quality, this repository uses:

- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests ([Jest Config](.config/jest.config.json)). Run with `npm test`.
- **Linting**: ESLint for code analysis ([ESLint Config](.config/.eslintrc.json)). Run with `npm run lint`.
- **Formatting**: Prettier for code formatting ([Prettier Config](.config/.prettierrc)). Run with `npm run format`.
- **TypeScript Config**: Ensuring type safety ([TypeScript Config](tsconfig.json)).

## ⚙️ Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions are configured to perform automated checks on pushes and pull requests, running the linter, formatter, and tests as outlined in [node.js.yml](.github/workflows/node.js.yml).
