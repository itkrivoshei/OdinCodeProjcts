## 🔧 Development Tools

To maintain high code quality, this repository uses:

- 🧪 **Testing**: Jest for unit tests. See [Jest Config](.config/jest.config.json).
  ```sh
  npm test
  ```
- 🕵️ **Linting**: ESLint for code analysis. See [ESLint Config](.config/.eslintrc.json).
  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```
- ✨ **Formatting**: Prettier for code formatting. See [Prettier Config](.config/.prettierrc).
  ```sh
  npm run format
  ```
- 🛠️ **TypeScript Config**: Ensuring type safety. See [TypeScript Config](.config/tsconfig.json).

## ⚙️ Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions are configured to perform automated checks on pushes and pull requests, running the linter, formatter, and tests as outlined in [node.js.yml](.github/workflows/node.js.yml).
