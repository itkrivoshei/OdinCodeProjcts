# 🧑‍💻 OdinCodeProjects

Welcome to the OdinCodeProjects repository, featuring various coding projects I've developed from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). These projects are focused on different concepts in JavaScript/TypeScript.

## 🗂 Project Directory

Delve into the projects, each with its own challenges and learnings:

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. To run these projects locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/itkrivoshei/OdinCodeProjcts.git
```

3. After cloning, install the dependencies at the root of the repository:

```
npm i
```

3. Then, feel free to navigate to each project's directory to explore further.

## 🔧 Development Tools

To maintain high code quality, this repository uses:

- **Testing**: `npm test` - Runs Jest for all unit tests.
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` - Lints the codebase with ESLint.
- **Formatting**: `npm run format` - Formats code using Prettier.

## ⚙️ Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions are configured to perform automated checks on pushes and pull requests, running the linter, formatter, and tests as outlined in [node.js.yml](.github/workflows/node.js.yml).
